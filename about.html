            I'm a person who sees stuff he likes and makes stuff that he likes using stuff he likes. <br>
            I make designs, some functional, some speculative <br>
            I make art, some doodles, some paintings <br>
            And I'm always ready to explore different avenues to make my pieces a well-rounded experience. 
            Exploring the intersection of Art, technology and interaction, I try to keep my work grounded in crafting
            a personal relationship with its target audience.

            I've lived in three different cities my entire life, each one of them being cultural hotpots of 
            vibrant and vastly different personalities. I bring along with my work an understanding of this 
            multiculturalism and a deeply rooted desire for universal work.
