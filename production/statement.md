I like to make things. 
I like to make things that people like. 
I like to make things that I like.
I like a lot of things. 
Art poetry story-writing storyboarding animation creative coding performance art installation art experiences interaction design web design generative art sketching doodling comic-writing web-comics illustration matte paintings character design music visualization sound design video editing comedy tragedy adventure and more.
The list is never-ending. 
I've lived in three different cities my entire life, each one of them being cultural hotpots of vibrant and vastly different personalities. I bring along with my work an understanding of this multiculturalism and a deeply rooted desire for universal work. 
I'm just a person 
I'm a person who sees stuff he likes and makes stuff that he likes using stuff he likes for people to like. 
I make designs, some functional, some speculative
I make art, some doodles, some paintings
And I'm always ready to explore new horizons and avenues to make my pieces a well-rounded experience. 
Exploring the intersection of Art, technology and interaction, I try to keep my work grounded in crafting a personal relationship with its target audience. 
There are three main values I hold dear to anything I make-
### *Tell stories through details*

- Each and every element of the project must add to the message or the story.
- Use specific elements of the project to narrate a story rather than telling the audience directly

### *Don't overcomplicate*

- If you can get the same effect by using a simpler medium/technique, then don't hesitate in doing so.
- Don't be flashy unless it assists the concept.

### *Be ready to do whatever it takes to elevate the concept*

- If the project will seriously benefit from a new skill that you have never practiced before, then go out of your way to learn that new skill
- Make sure not to learn it alone, and ask friends/mentors if they have experience in this new skill.
- learn through practicing


I'm a just person 
I liked the stuff that I made
And I hope you do too.
